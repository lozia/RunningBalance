## Description
Our project is a balance calculator that allows users to track their income and expenses. Users can view their income and expense details, total value, and current balance. They can also add or delete an income or expense record. Each detail includes information such as date, category, description, and more, providing users with a comprehensive overview of their finances.

In addition to the financial tracking features, our project includes a dashboard that displays daily news and weather updates for user convenience. Furthermore, we have incorporated a pie chart visualization of expenses to help users easily identify areas where they may be overspending.
