## Description
Our project is a web-based application that allows users to create their own blogs and share their posts with the world. The application has a social media component, allowing users to follow other bloggers and see their posts in their feed. Users can also like, comment, and share posts with their followers. The application has a search feature that allows users to search for other bloggers or posts based on keywords. The application also allows people to use the chat function to send private messages to other users.
